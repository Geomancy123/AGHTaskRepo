Capture the flag Controls:

RMB on a blue player to gain control of that target
RMB anywhere except a character to unselect the character (if it is on the opposing side of the map, it will become an attacker)
LMB while player is selected to move player

bugs: sometimes the obstacle avoidance makes the attackers glitch out. I've tried to solve it but alas.
