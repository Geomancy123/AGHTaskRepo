Repo for the AGH technical task


Almost everything is done, bar two.

The audio does not fade out/in when pausing/playing. This is what I was attempting when I ran out of time.
The controls currently use WASD, not touch swiping. I have never coded for a touch screen, so I wanted to make everything else work before I started researching how to do that.
